        <p>Welcome to my educational journey! I'm thrilled to share my path through the world of learning, and how it has shaped who I am today.</p>
        
        <br>

        <h3>Early Education</h3>
        <p>My academic adventure began in the halls of The Frank Anthony Public School, where I discovered my love for learning.
            From there, I continued to nurture my intellectual curiosity. These formative years instilled in me a solid foundation for further education.</p>


        <br>

        <h3>Higher Education</h3>
        <p>My pursuit of knowledge led me to The Brigham Young University,Idaho, where I majored in Computer Information Technology.
            The university experience was transformative, providing me with a wealth of knowledge and life lessons.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
        <p>Beyond the classroom, I actively engaged in extracurricular activities such as Cybersecurity Society where I have participated in various events.
            These experiences allowed me to develop essential skills, forge lifelong friendships, and broaden my horizons.
            When I'm not immersed in the world of academia and technology, you'll often find me on the soccer field, passionately pursuing my love for the beautiful game.
            Soccer has been a cherished part of my life, providing an outlet for both physical fitness and sheer enjoyment.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope my experiences inspire and motivate others to embrace the joys of lifelong learning.</p>
